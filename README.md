## The Odin Project: *Admin Dashboard*

The goal of this assignment was to create an admin dashboard page loosely based on a design provided by The Odin Project. We were encouraged to use Grid as much as we could, resisting the urge to use Flex.

Despite the assignment being an opportunity to practice our Grid skills, it made me appreciate the differences between the two, Grid & Flex, and the different use cases for each one.
